I used ChatGPT to help me remind the basics of docker containers and to give me some hints 
for coding. 
LLM helped me to focus on the important parts of the exercise because it made it faster to solve some bugs
that could have taken lot of time manually. 
It was little bit difficult for LLM to understand how to get data from another container, and lot of problem solving 
had to be made on my own. I also didn't want LLM to do everything for me for learning purposes.
